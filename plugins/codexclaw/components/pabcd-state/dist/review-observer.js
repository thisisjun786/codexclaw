/**
 * review-observer.ts — SubagentStop observer that owns plan-audit approval (060).
 *
 * The whole point of REVIEW-BINDING-01 is that the agent cannot write its own
 * approval. An `open`/`close` CLI pair would have been the same self-attestation
 * the A>B gate already had, just spelled with two commands, so closing a round
 * with a verdict is not a command at all — it happens here, when a reviewer
 * subagent actually ends its turn.
 *
 * Never blocks. The existing worker evidence gate does the denying (matcher
 * `^(executor|worker)$`); this observer excludes both implementation types, so a read-only audit is
 * never held to a receipt it was designed to skip (DISPATCH-AGENT-TYPE-01), and
 * the two hooks cannot race over the same child.
 *
 * The exclusion is stated as "not worker" rather than "is explorer" on purpose
 * (050). The v1 spawn surface has no `agent_type` ARGUMENT, so a dispatch cannot
 * label its reviewer — an "is explorer" test drops every v1 sign-off before the
 * round can even be named.
 *
 * 260818: the earlier note that such a payload "reaches us blank" was wrong, and
 * the registered matcher was wrong with it. codex-rs normalises a child with no
 * role to the agent_type `default` (a v1 spawn records `agent_role: null` in its
 * session_meta), so `^(explorer)?$` — which admits only "" and "explorer" —
 * matched nothing and the hook command never ran. That is why a dropped verdict
 * left NO ledger line at all: the refusal below cannot write what was never
 * invoked. The matcher is now `.*` and the worker exclusion here is what keeps
 * the receipt gate and this observer off each other's children. Since the type is
 * no longer a filter, treat every non-worker exit as a possible reviewer and let
 * the sign-off decide.
 *
 * Dropping that test costs identity, so the round re-earns it: the first
 * sign-off BINDS the round to its agent id, and a later sign-off from a
 * different child is refused (050 §3b). Launch ids are minted from a round
 * number and a timestamp, so they are guessable — they name a round, they do
 * not authenticate a reviewer. Child hooks also inherit the PARENT session id
 * (cli.ts), so ownerSessionId cannot separate two children of one session.
 *
 * Fail-open on every IO or parse error: a missed recording costs one more audit
 * round, while a thrown observer would break an unrelated subagent's exit.
