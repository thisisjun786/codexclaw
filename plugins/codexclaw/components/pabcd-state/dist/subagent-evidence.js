/**
 * subagent-evidence.ts — SubagentStop evidence-receipt gate (lazygap_impl 010).
 *
 * A dispatched WRITE/verify subagent (agent_type "executor", or legacy "worker") cannot "finish" without a
 * non-empty evidence receipt under `.codexclaw/evidence/`. Missing/invalid receipt ->
 * `decision:"block"` with a verifier directive that re-prompts the CHILD (codex-rs
 * turn.rs:323). After MAX_ATTEMPTS the directive escalates but remains fail-closed;
 * untrusted child transcript text can never exempt itself from verification.
 *
 * EVIDENCE-TERMINAL-01 (260826): "fail-closed" used to mean the escalation branch
 * returned a block FOREVER. That trapped exactly the population it could not help — a
 * child dispatched read-only cannot create a file under the parent's
 * `.codexclaw/evidence/`, so it could never satisfy the demand and never stop being
 * asked. A real transcript shows 15+ identical escalation blocks.
 *
 * The budget is now terminal: at the cap the gate records an unresolved TOMBSTONE in
 * session state and releases the child. Verification is not waived — it moves to the
 * only actor that can act on it: GOAL-COMPLETE-GATE-01 denies `update_goal
 * {status:"complete"}` while a tombstone is unresolved. Fail-closed on the VERDICT,
 * bounded on the CONTROL FLOW.
 *
 * Translates omo's `lazycodex-executor-verify` pattern into codexclaw's no-server model,
 * using direct node:fs (matching interview-ledger.ts / state.ts — no fs-injection seam).
 *
 * Ground truth (codex-rs):
 *  - SubagentStop fires only for thread-spawned children: hook_runtime.rs:300
 *  - stdin carries agent_type/agent_id/last_assistant_message + BOTH transcript paths
 *    (transcript_path = parent, agent_transcript_path = child): schema.rs:576, hook_runtime.rs:302
 *  - decision:"block" + reason re-prompts the child's own turn: stop.rs:263,351 + turn.rs:323
