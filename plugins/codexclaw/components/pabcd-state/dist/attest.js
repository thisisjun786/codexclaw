 * the agent's own laziness/hallucination, not a malicious human. The gate forces the
 * agent to commit to a specific `did` narrative; for A->B to paste the independent
 * reviewer's verdict (`auditOutput` — WP3, so the Audit gate structurally requires a
 * dispatched reviewer, not a self-written sentence) plus the main agent's structured
 * judgment fields; and for C->D to paste real command output with a passing exit code.
 * A boolean is NOT accepted as evidence (cheaper to hallucinate than prose), so the
 * audit/check flags can only flip true through here.
 *
 * No server, no IO: pure validation. Callers (cli.ts / orchestrate) persist the
 * resulting flags via state.writeState. This is the runtime enforcement that 007 R-2
 * demands — the evidence gate must be structural, not prompt prose.
