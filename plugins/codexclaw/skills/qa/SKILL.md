# cxc-qa — Manual Surface QA Gate

Prove a built surface works by DRIVING it, not by inferring from green tests.
No scenario closes on a status string; it closes on a captured artifact from a
real surface, an adversarial pass, and a teardown receipt. Everything in this
skill is E7 discipline (agent-followed, not hook-enforced); the one shipped E2
touchpoint is noted in §7. Lineage: lazycodex `visual-qa` / `review-work` /
`lazycodex-qa-executor` (vendored at `devlog/.lazycodex/`), translated to
codexclaw's no-server, Codex-native-tool model.

## Modular References

| File | When to Read | What It Covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `references/visual-qa.md` | ANY visual surface verdict (web UI, TUI) | Visual artifact rubric: companion-skill grounding (QA-VISUAL-COMPANION-01), objective-metrics-first (QA-VISUAL-METRIC-01), oracle judge limits, extended adversarial classes, TUI harness options |
| `references/http-api-qa.md` | HTTP API surface scenarios | Wire-driving procedure (QA-HTTP-01): curl capture discipline, auth-state/contract/idempotency/boundary/content-negotiation/CORS axes, status-code truth table |
| `references/cli-tui-qa.md` | CLI or TUI surface scenarios | Session mechanics (QA-CLI-01): stdout/stderr separation, TTY-vs-pipe, env/config precedence, signal cleanup, tmux lifecycle + wait-for-marker driving |

Browser selection (QA-TOOL-LADDER-01) is owned by
[portable browser routing](../dev/references/browser-routing.md). Suitable available
Aside, agbrowse and native browser capabilities may drive built UI; none is required.

## 0. Scope split (single ownership)

- `cxc-dev-testing` owns AUTOMATED verification: unit, contract, E2E,
  Playwright suites and CI gates. Browser selection lives in the shared dev policy;
  `dev-testing` §4.7 connects that policy to exploratory tests.
- `cxc-qa` (this skill) owns the manual QA PROCEDURE: scenario matrix,
  faithful channels, evidence contract, adversarial classes, oracle passes,
  teardown receipts.
- Both feed PABCD C. Neither replaces the other: a green suite without a
  driven surface can still ship a broken border or a dead route; a driven
  surface without a suite has no regression guard. Promote a QA flow to a
  deterministic test (dev-testing §4.1) when it must stay guarded.

## 1. Trust nothing

Executor claims, previous logs, transcript memory, and evidence summaries are
untrusted until you inspect or reproduce them. A remembered "it worked" is not
evidence (FAMILY-PROOF-01). Every PASS points at a non-empty artifact you (or
your dispatched QA worker) captured THIS round.

## 2. Surface detection + faithful channels

State the exact surface and invocation BEFORE running each scenario. Use the
channel faithful to the surface — CLI output parsed from the wrong layer is
not evidence of the layer you changed:

| Surface | Faithful channel | Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HTTP API | `curl -i` (headers + body) — scenarios in `references/http-api-qa.md` | response capture |
| CLI | real invocation, stdout/stderr split + exit code — discipline in `references/cli-tui-qa.md` | terminal capture |
| TUI | tmux session at FIXED dims — mechanics in `references/cli-tui-qa.md`, visual rubric in `references/visual-qa.md` | plain + ANSI captures |
| Web UI | browser screenshot at a STATED viewport, read via `view_image` — workflow in `references/visual-qa.md` | screenshot(s) |
| Desktop GUI | computer-use + screenshots (per-app approval; never drive terminals/Codex itself) | screenshots + action log |

Tool choice for the browser/CU rows follows the shared portable browser policy; the inspect -> act -> re-inspect protocol applies. Data-shaped behavior
may use parsed CLI/data output as its channel.

## 3. Evidence contract

Artifacts live under `.codexclaw/evidence/<sessionId>/qa/<scenario-id>/`:

- `invocation.txt` — the exact command(s)/steps, copy-pasteable.
- the artifact(s) — capture, screenshot, response, transcript.
- `verdict.json` — `{ "scenario": "<id>", "criterion": "<what this proves>",
  "surface": "http|cli|tui|web|gui", "verdict": "PASS|FAIL|NA",
  "artifactRefs": ["<relative paths>"], "note": "<one line>",
  "capturedAt": "<RFC3339>", "sourceSnapshotAt": { "kind": "resolved|unavailable",
  "commitSha": "<sha>", "dirty": <bool>, "capturedAt": "<RFC3339>",
  "treeHash": "<sha256, dirty only>" } }`.
  On `web` and `gui` only, also `"captureChecks": { "signature": <bool>,
  "nonEmpty": <bool>, "dimensionsMatch": <bool>, "composited": <bool> }` —
  all four keys (QA-CAPTURE-INTEGRITY-01 in `references/visual-qa.md`).

Rules:

- Every PASS names at least one non-empty artifact in `artifactRefs`.
- `capturedAt` and `sourceSnapshotAt` are required on every surface: knowing
  when evidence was captured, and against which tree, does not depend on what
  kind of surface produced it (QA-EVIDENCE-FRESHNESS-01).
- `inferred` and `partial` verdicts DO NOT EXIST — a scenario either ran
  against the real surface or it did not.
- A scenario that cannot run is a FAIL carrying the blocker and the missing
  prerequisite, not a skip.
- `NA` is legal only when the class structurally cannot apply to the surface
  (e.g. viewport class on a headless API), always with a recorded reason.
- This directory is shared with the SubagentStop receipt gate's root
  (`.codexclaw/evidence/`); main-session QA artifacts do not interact with
  worker receipts (the gate validates only the worker's own
  `EVIDENCE_RECORDED:` marker path).
- A worker that CANNOT write there was dispatched wrong, not gated wrong: read-only
  lanes belong on `agent_type:"explorer"`, which the gate never touches. The retry
  budget is terminal, so a mis-routed worker is released rather than trapped — but its
  verdict stays unresolved and blocks goal completion until a receipt settles it.

After every scenario is done, emit the aggregate receipt:

```
node plugins/codexclaw/skills/qa/scripts/validate-evidence.mjs \
  .codexclaw/evidence/<sessionId>/qa/ --emit-receipt
```

It validates every `verdict.json`, confirms they all describe the same tree,
and writes `.codexclaw/evidence/<sessionId>/qa-receipt.json`. Any failure
leaves no receipt behind, including deleting one an earlier run produced —
a receipt that outlives the QA it attests to is worse than none.

Current limitation: the final gate does not pick this file up on its own. Until
the `final-gate` lifecycle CLI exists, point `finalGate.qaReceiptPath` at that
path by editing the goalplan directly. Remove this paragraph when that CLI lands.

## 4. Adversarial classes

For each scenario, probe every APPLICABLE class and record the observable
result per class (own row in the matrix):

1. Empty/absent input (no args, empty body, blank field).
2. Malformed input (bad flag, invalid JSON, wrong type, unknown enum).
3. Boundary size (longest plausible value, zero-length list, max count).
4. Repeat/concurrent invocation (double-submit, rerun idempotence).
5. (web/TUI only) Narrow viewport / narrow terminal width + CJK text
   (clipping, baseline drop, wide-char column drift, border misalignment).

Class 5 findings feed the visual pass in §5. N/A classes follow the §3 rule.
Surface-specialized class details: `http-api-qa.md` (wire), `cli-tui-qa.md`
(terminal), `visual-qa.md` (extended visual classes).

## 5. Oracle passes (depth scales by work class)

- **C2**: run the matrix yourself; one self-review pass over the artifacts
  before writing verdicts.
- **C3+ with a visual surface**: dispatch TWO parallel read-only reviewer
  passes (`spawn_agent`, explorer role, DISPATCH-TASK-01 packet; paste the
  captures/screenshot paths + script/tool observations into each prompt —
  do not make the oracle re-derive context):
  Both passes are rubric-bound: attach `cxc-dev-frontend` (anti-slop +
  visual-verification checklist ARE the rubric) and, for design-direction
  judgments only, `cxc-dev-uiux-design`; every PASS cites the rule ids it
  checked (QA-VISUAL-COMPANION-01, `references/visual-qa.md`). Capture the
  objective evidence layer FIRST (viewport matrix, DOM text extraction for
  text/CJK claims, console errors — QA-VISUAL-METRIC-01).
  - Pass A — design-system + functional integrity: is this a real, coherent
    implementation driven by reused primitives (not a mock-only screen or a
    pasted raster), and do the intended features actually work?
  - Pass B — visual fidelity + CJK precision: open the screenshots/captures
    directly; hunt clipping, baseline drop, glyph breakage, KO/JA/ZH
    precision, border/box-drawing drift.
  Synthesize both into one PASS / REVISE / FAIL in the MAIN session. On FAIL,
  REVIEW-SYNTHESIS-01 applies before any re-dispatch; revision rounds reuse
  the same oracle (DISPATCH-ACTOR-01), and the final C gate gets a fresh one.
- Long passes: require `WORKING: <task> - <phase>` progress messages and
  `BLOCKED: <reason>` from dispatched QA workers; a wait timeout is not a
  failure signal (a running child is alive). A lane that crashed or returned
  no deliverable is INCONCLUSIVE — never counted as PASS.

## 6. Teardown receipts

Every resource the QA pass spawned — dev-server PIDs, ports, tmux sessions,
browser tabs, containers, temp dirs — gets its own teardown line WITH proof:
`lsof -i :<port>` empty, `tmux ls` clean, `ps` check, `rm` + absent check.
A stateless pass records an explicit "no resources spawned" line with what was
checked. No QA asset is left running after the verdict.

## 7. Binding to PABCD C

A user-facing surface change closes C with BOTH: the automated gate
(dev-testing) AND this skill's QA matrix — any FAIL verdict blocks the C>D
claim until repaired (LOOP-REPAIR-01 counts apply) or the criterion is
re-scoped through a P-phase amendment, never silently. This is E7 discipline:
no hook reads verdict.json. The E2 touchpoint: QA delegated to a registered `executor`
subagent rides the existing SubagentStop receipt gate (legacy `worker` also supported) — the executor cannot
finish without a non-empty receipt under `.codexclaw/evidence/`.

## v2 candidates (deliberately not shipped)

- Node-only ports of lazycodex's `image-diff` / `tui-check` scoring scripts
  (objective similarity/overflow JSON as oracle reference input). v1 uses
  direct `view_image` inspection + inline width checks; vendor scripts only
  if field friction shows the inline checks miss real defects.
- A review-work-style multi-lane orchestrator: not planned — the A gate,
  C adversarial review, REVIEW-SYNTHESIS-01, and this skill already cover
  those lanes without a 5-spawn token bill.
