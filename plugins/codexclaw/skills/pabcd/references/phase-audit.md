# Audit phase

2. **A — Audit**: Adversarial, read-only review of the plan against the real codebase. Dispatch an independent read-only reviewer using the exposed spawn schema (`agent_type:"reviewer"` when available; otherwise supported `agent_type:"explorer"` with `CXC-ROLE: reviewer` before `TASK:`, per DISPATCH-AGENT-TYPE-01) — even a small/mini-model one — to challenge assumptions, find blockers (rollback gaps, missing callers, phantom constants), and verify references. For each conditional path the plan adds, the reviewer also asks: is the trigger reachable at all from states the system actually visits (callers exist, preconditions can co-occur, upstream code does not consume the trigger first), and does the plan name its activation scenario (C-ACTIVATION-GROUNDING-01)? An unreachable-by-construction branch is a plan blocker, not a C-phase discovery. The reviewer also checks: new devlog phase documents use the numbered lexicographic filename convention; bare-named or research/implementation-mixed docs are a FAIL (LEXICO-SPLIT-01). Multi-phase units satisfy DIFFLEVEL-ROADMAP-01: every roadmap phase has a diff-level decade doc (no outline-only or missing phases), and the phase map is dependency-ordered, not effort-bucketed (PHASE-SPLIT-01). **Audit loop (STRICT, AUDIT-LOOP-01):** A is a loop — audit -> synthesize -> amend plan -> re-audit — not a single round. Exit A>B only when the MAIN agent judges the round **pass** (reviewer approved) or **near-pass**: every High/Critical blocker was folded into the plan as a concrete amendment or explicitly rebutted with recorded rationale, and only non-blocking residuals remain (`GO-WITH-FIXES; 2 blockers folded back` qualifies — the main agent is the judge, not a string parser). A FAIL round never exits: apply REVIEW-SYNTHESIS-01 (loop-engineering.md §11.3), amend the plan, and re-audit with the SAME reviewer (V2 `followup_task` to its task_name or V1 `send_input` to its agent_id; DISPATCH-ACTOR-01); LOOP-REPAIR-01 bounds the loop — after 3 failed rounds return to P with a changed plan (HITL may return to Interview). The dispatch packet explicitly names `$codexclaw:cxc-dev-code-reviewer` AND `$codexclaw:cxc-search` (reference/version/external-claim verification rides the search ladder) and instructs the reviewer to end with a normalized final line `VERDICT: PASS | GO-WITH-FIXES (blockers=N) | FAIL` plus numbered blockers. No code changes. The `A>B` attest structurally requires `auditOutput` (the pasted tail of the reviewer's verdict) plus `auditVerdict` (`pass|near-pass|fail` — the MAIN agent's own judgment of the round); `near-pass` additionally requires `auditResidual` naming each residual blocker and its disposition (folded/rebutted). A declared `fail` never advances, and a pasted tail whose final verdict line says FAIL is rejected regardless of the claimed judgment. Still a form-only bar: the gate cannot verify the paste's provenance, so faithful execution (really dispatching the reviewer, really looping) remains the agent's obligation.

   **Plan-rule checks (PLAN-VERIFIER-REAL-01 / PLAN-FIELD-CHAIN-01 / PLAN-BYPASS-NAMED-01).** The reviewer additionally verifies, and any one of these failing is a blocker: (a) every verifier command the plan names actually exists AND reads the change target — the reviewer RUNS it rather than trusting the plan; (b) each new field/enum value has its full creation -> serialization -> deserialization -> consumer chain enumerated, with `N/A + reason` where a stage does not apply; (c) when several documents reference a shared type, the field NAMES match, not just the concept; (d) each document's header dependency declaration matches the types its body actually uses; (e) any plan adding enforcement records the five bypass fields (tier / executing surface / known bypass / residual risk / wording downgrade) and either names the final enforcement layer or states `none`.

   **Verification is not pinned to A (LEAN-REVIEW-01, 260818).** `cxc review-round open` still exists, and a verdict a reviewer's exit records is still honoured: it cannot be contradicted by your attest, spent after a re-plan, or spent on a plan that changed since. What changed is that an open round no longer BLOCKS `A>B`. It used to, and that produced a deadlock — every reason the SubagentStop observer did not fire (a matcher that missed the runtime's role vocabulary, a reviewer whose closing lines did not parse, a reinstall that moved `PLUGIN_ROOT` out from under a live session) became a cycle that could never leave A, whose only escape was hand-feeding the hook its own payload. A gate whose normal recovery is forging its own input is not a gate.

   Dispatch reviewers wherever they actually help — plan audit at A, implementation lanes at B, verification lanes at C — instead of treating A as the one phase that owns review. Open a round when you want the verdict bound to the plan hash and this cycle; otherwise attest and move. Both are honest; only claiming a reviewer ran when none did is not.
   When the verdict is FAIL, fold-back follows REVIEW-SYNTHESIS-01 (loop-engineering.md §11.3): synthesize root causes and accept/rebut decisions before re-planning or re-dispatching the reviewer.

- **Reviewer reuse across repair rounds (pointer):** blocker-closure re-verification
  rounds reuse the SAME reviewer — V2 `followup_task` to its task_name (triggers a
  turn when idle; `send_message` is context-only) or V1 `send_input` to its agent_id —
  passing the synthesis plus a change-diff summary so the reviewer keeps its context.
  The final C adversarial gate (or any contaminated reviewer) gets a fresh reviewer or
  a direct independent audit instead. Normative lifecycle rules: DISPATCH-ACTOR-01 /
  DISPATCH-RETIRE-01 in `structure/20_pabcd_dispatch_doctrine.md` §3
  (repository-only provenance, not an installed prerequisite).

## Architect recheck after audit amendments

Keep the independent reviewer and its audit loop. Reinvoke the plan's architect only
when an amendment changes a documented design decision: module responsibility,
data structure, interface or execution flow. Main names the decision ID, before/after
and reason, updates the executable plan, and requests reflection from the SAME architect
before completing A. Text edits or test clarification alone do not trigger a call.
If test work changes an interface or flow decision, that decision change does.
Record the reflection and main disposition separately, then re-audit the amended plan
with the reviewer. Lifecycle and failure handling: [delegation](delegation.md#architect-context-and-routing).

Prefer receiving the reviewer result before requesting architect revisions; if opening a new
review round, do so after reflection. An unsigned architect exit overlapping an in-flight A
round can produce `review_signoff_unparsed` in the existing review observer. That is a
diagnostic about missing reviewer sign-off, not architect failure, A approval or a gate
verdict. Record its cause if it occurs. Do not manufacture `LAUNCH`/`VERDICT` reviewer
sign-off for the architect; its `ALIGNED`/`MISALIGNED` result has a different purpose.
