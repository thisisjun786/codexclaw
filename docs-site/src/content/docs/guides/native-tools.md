title: Native Tools
description: How codexclaw skills route to Codex's native capabilities — browser use, computer use, deferred collab tools, imagegen, view_image, and update_plan.
---

codexclaw's discipline is only half the story — the Codex runtime already ships powerful
native surfaces, and the skills now route to them by exact tool id. The verified
inventory lives in `structure/60_native_capabilities.md` (re-verified per Codex release).

## The two collab surfaces

V1 is codexclaw's default, but the model catalog selects V2 for sol/terra and V1 for
luna; `features.multi_agent_v2` is the fallback selector for other models. The chosen
surface pins on the session's first turn. V1 collab tools
(`multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent` / `wait_agent` / `send_input` / `resume_agent` /
`close_agent`) are deferred behind `tool_search`; V2 tools are direct. If
`spawn_agent` is not visible, run `tool_search` for it first.

V1 parses skill mentions natively. On plaintext V2 provider/proxy paths, the spawn hook
normalizes mentions and inlines recognized SKILL.md bodies. Native ChatGPT-backend V2
gives the hook encrypted message ciphertext, so both operations are no-ops there. When no
body can be inlined, the hook appends a plaintext `[CXC-SKILL-AFFORDANCE]` block telling
the child to self-load any `$cxc-<folder>` / `$codexclaw:cxc-<folder>` mention from
`<skillsDir>/<folder>/SKILL.md`; fork inheritance remains a secondary channel. The other
reliable native V2 hook channels are the leaf guard and omitted configured model/effort
injection on non-full-history spawns.

## Hook trust

Codex pins each hook identity as `hooks.state.<key>.trusted_hash` in
`~/.codex/config.toml` and silently skips a hook whose current hash drifts. After any edit,
commit, or merge touching `plugins/codexclaw/hooks/*.json`, run `cxc doctor`. If it reports
a drifted or untrusted hook, run `cxc hooks retrust` to back up the config and atomically
record safely recomputed hashes, then rerun `cxc doctor`.

Those entries are written by the host Codex binary when you approve a plugin's hooks, not
by codexclaw. A fresh install therefore starts with no `[hooks.state.*]` sections at all,
and `cxc doctor` reports every hook as `untrusted ... actual=(none)` until the approval
happens. codexclaw will not write them on your behalf as a side effect of installation:
that would bypass the trust prompt the mechanism exists to enforce. To record them
deliberately, run the command `cxc doctor` prints, which needs `--bootstrap-ok` only when
no entry exists yet:

```bash
cxc hooks retrust --key codexclaw@codexclaw --bootstrap-ok
```

On Windows, `retrust` verifies its own write by running `codex features list`. It resolves
that executable before spawning it, because a bare `codex` hits either the Store-packaged
`WindowsApps` binary (`EPERM`) or the npm `.cmd` shim (`EINVAL`). Set `CODEX_BIN` to an
explicit path if you keep `codex` somewhere the PATH walk cannot see.

## Browse-use ladder (owned by `cxc-search`)

Proof-of-source escalates through named tools, stopping at the first rung that yields
primary evidence:

**agbrowse is the primary surface** while it resolves; the native tools are its
fallback tier:

1. `agbrowse fetch --json --browser never` — scripted HTTP proof; the mandatory first
   attempt (its JSON envelope is the evidence artifact)
2. agbrowse CDP — one-shot `fetch --browser auto` for JS/blocked pages, or an
   interactive session (`start --headed` → `navigate` → `snapshot --interactive` →
   `click eN` → `stop`) when steps must act on the page
   **If an agbrowse command fails (connection refused, no browser, etc.), run
   `agbrowse start` first to launch the local Chrome session, then retry.**
3. Native fallback — `browser:control-in-app-browser` (JS/PDF/visual) and
   `chrome:control-chrome` (conversational real-profile CDP), used when agbrowse is
   unresolvable or cannot complete the flow (state why)
4. `computer-use:computer-use` — GUI-only last resort (per-app approval)

Every interactive rung follows the verification loop: inspect → act → re-inspect, with
screenshot + `view_image` fallback when DOM inspection fails.

## Computer-use QA (owned by `cxc-dev-testing` §4.6)

Playwright owns deterministic suites; the native tools own exploratory QA — "does this
change work in the real UI right now". Drive the flow, capture screenshots, read them
back with `view_image`, and attach them as PABCD C-phase evidence. Promote flows that
must stay guarded into Playwright.

## Other natives now wired into skills

| Tool | Where it's used |
|---|---|
| `update_plan` | `cxc-pabcd` PLAN-TRACK-01 — mirror plan items, keep statuses live through B |
| `imagegen` | `cxc-dev-frontend` / `cxc-dev-uiux-design` — real bitmap assets instead of placeholders |
| `view_image` | design reads, screenshot evidence, blocked-source captures |
| `multi_tool_use.parallel` | `cxc-lunasearch` / `cxc-search` Tier-3 parallel lanes |
| `list_available_plugins_to_install` / `request_plugin_install` | `cxc-skill-hub` capability discovery |

CSV batch fan-out via `spawn_agents_on_csv` remains flag-gated and is documented as a
future surface. `memories.dedicated_tools` is not: `cxc enable` turns it on so
`memories.search` / `read` / `list` / `add_ad_hoc_note` appear, and `cxc disable`
restores the previous value. The write tool is still denied unless the user asked
to remember something or the session holds a `cxc memory allow-write` grant.
V2 is live through catalog selection or the fallback feature flag; it is not part
of this "not shipped" set.
