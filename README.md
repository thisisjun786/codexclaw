---

codexclaw turns the Codex runtime into a disciplined development environment. It does not ship its own agent harness — it layers skills, hooks, and components directly on `codex`, adding structured workflows, coding discipline, and multi-model orchestration that the base runtime doesn't provide.

## Features

**Dev Skill Family** — 12 surface-specific routers (`dev-architecture`, `dev-backend`, `dev-frontend`, `dev-testing`, `dev-security`, `dev-debugging`, `dev-data`, `dev-devops`, `dev-code-reviewer`, `dev-scaffolding`, `dev-diagram-viewer`, `dev-uiux-design`) governed by a canonical parent (`dev`). Every router inherits the parent's rule classes, verification gate, and safety rules. 155 unique rule IDs across the family.

**PABCD Workflow** — Plan / Audit / Build / Check / Done, implemented as a file-backed FSM with attestation-gated transitions. Phases advance through `cxc orchestrate` commands; each transition carries structured evidence. A durable goalplan ledger tracks work phases, success criteria, and captured proof across multiple cycles.

```
IDLE ── P ── A ── B ── C ── D ── IDLE
       │    │    │
      gate  gate gate
       └────┴────┴──── I (Interview, context preserved)
```

**Multi-Model Subagents** — role-based dispatch (explorer / reviewer / executor) with per-role model and prompt overrides. Configuration persists across sessions and applies automatically through the spawn-wrapper hook. A local GUI (Vite + React) provides visual config and, when opencodex is detected, a provider link bar. (Dashboard: build from a repo checkout for now; bundled in a follow-up release.)

**Recall** — searches past Codex conversations and the memory store from disk artifacts before asking the user, so context survives session boundaries and compaction.

**Repo Map** — `cxc map <dir>` runs tree-sitter parsing + PageRank ranking to produce a structure overview of unfamiliar code, letting the agent orient before deep `rg` dives. (Repo checkout only — requires the vendored Python toolchain.)

**Skill Search** — `cxc skill search <query>` discovers dormant skills across cli-jaw-skills (primary), ClawHub, and Hermes catalogs. `cxc skill show <id>` loads them on demand.

## Install

2 lines to install. No build step, no npm install, no config edits.

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/lidge-jun/codexclaw
codex plugin add codexclaw@codexclaw
```

Then restart Codex and approve the 23 hooks when prompted (upgrades ask again — content-hash trust). Everything runs from chat, and the terminal surface ships too — the payload includes its own `cxc` dispatcher, so agent-driven `cxc orchestrate` commands work on every install:

- `orchestrate status` — check the PABCD state machine
- "Interview me first, then draft a diff-level plan."
- "Plan this with codexclaw PABCD and use multi-model subagents."

<details>
<summary><b>Update / uninstall / optional CLI</b></summary>

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade codexclaw   # update
codex plugin remove codexclaw@codexclaw      # uninstall
```

After an upgrade Codex marks the hooks **Modified** — re-approve them to reactivate.
Upgrading to 0.1.1+ also delivers the payload CLI (`bin/cxc.mjs`); existing installs must upgrade (or re-add) to receive new top-level directories.

The CLI has two tiers. Every install ships the payload dispatcher — no PATH setup needed; when `cxc` isn't on PATH, the session-start banner prints this exact invocation:

```bash
node "<plugin-root>/bin/cxc.mjs" orchestrate status --session <id>
```

A PATH-level `cxc` is an optional convenience from a repository checkout (also unlocks `cxc map` and `cxc gui`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lidge-jun/codexclaw
alias cxc='node /path/to/codexclaw/bin/codexclaw.mjs'   # or: npm link
```

_The PATH-level `cxc` entry (`bin/codexclaw.mjs` + `cli/` workspace) lives at the repository root; the payload's `bin/cxc.mjs` dispatcher covers the same verbs (minus `map`/`gui`) on marketplace installs._

## Dev Skill Family

Every coding task is classified (C0-C5) before process depth is chosen. The parent `dev` skill routes to surface-specific routers based on what's being changed:

| Surface | Router | Also loads |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Backend / API | `dev-backend` | `dev-security` for auth |
| Frontend / UI | `dev-frontend` | `dev-uiux-design` for direction |
| Database / data | `dev-data` | `dev-backend` for migrations |
| Tests / QA | `dev-testing` | `dev-frontend` for browser QA |
| Security | `dev-security` | surface-specific router |
| Architecture | `dev-architecture` | `dev-scaffolding` for structure |
| Debugging | `dev-debugging` | surface-specific router |
| DevOps / infra | `dev-devops` | `dev-security` for credentials |
| Scaffolding | `dev-scaffolding` | `dev-architecture` for boundaries |
| Code review | `dev-code-reviewer` | `dev-security` + `dev-testing` |
| Diagrams | `dev-diagram-viewer` | — |

Each router carries its own modular references (loaded on demand, never preloaded) and inherits the parent's verification gate, rule classes, and safety rules.

## CLI

```bash
cxc orchestrate P|A|B|C|D|status|reset   # PABCD phase control
cxc loop init|show|validate               # durable goalplan management
cxc scan record --session <id>            # record an interview contradiction-scan round
cxc map <dir>                             # tree-sitter structure map (repo checkout only)
cxc skill search <query>                  # remote skill discovery
cxc skill show <id>                       # load a discovered skill
cxc help                                  # command reference
```

On marketplace installs without a PATH-level `cxc`, the same verbs run as `node "<plugin-root>/bin/cxc.mjs" <verb>` — the session-start banner prints the exact path.

## Ecosystem

codexclaw is the reference implementation. The methodology and skills are ported (agent-neutral, no plugin dependency) to:

| Repo | Role |
|------|------|
| [pabcd_initiative](https://github.com/lidge-jun/pabcd_initiative) | Methodology spec + docs-site + agent-neutral skill set |
| [cli-jaw](https://github.com/lidge-jun/cli-jaw) | Boss/employee agent harness with skills_ref submodule |
| [ima2-gen](https://github.com/lidge-jun/ima2-gen) | Image generation tool with ima2-front/ima2-uiux skills |
